# EECS348-Group-Project 
by David Donaldson, Noah O'grady, Hamzeh Al-Tamari, Ian Collins, Ky Jost

Project Description:

This project purpose is to create a functional calculator that can perform the order of operations on a inputted expression while recognizing any errors that may occur
within the program. We are using c++ for our back-end and html/javascript for the front-end I/O. This site is intended to run locally for now however, as we do not have 
a domain to host the site. We worked on this project all semester as a term project to demonstrate the software engineering process and how team development works within
the field. 

Our Team:

Our team leader is David who set up the Teams, GitHub and was our liaison to our professor as well as working on the order of operations code. Ky kept notes at all of 
our meetings throughout the semester and worked on the error handling portion of the code. Noah created the front-end I/O for the project including the HTML and JavaScript 
to connect the front end to the back-end. Ianworked on the error handling portion of the code and is the quality assurance representitive for the documention and source 
code. Hamzeh worked on the order of operations code while also working on quality assurance. Every member of the group participated in the development of this project from
documentation to implemtation. 

How To Use Our Project:

This software runs using a website to pass an arithemtic expression to our code which returns either the result of the expression or error(s) of the given expression. 
Possible errors are syntax and arithemetic errors ranging from mismatched parantheses, invalid characters, invalid operators, divide by zero, or taking the power of a 
negative number. The user guild to the program is relatively straight forward:

  1. Enter a possibly valid arithmetic expression
  2. Press the 'Solve' button
  3. Recieve either the result or error(s)
